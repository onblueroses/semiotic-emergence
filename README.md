# semiotic-emergence

Evolutionary simulation exploring whether a communication system can emerge from natural selection alone. Prey with evolvable neural networks navigate a toroidal grid with invisible kill zones - regions that silently drain energy until death. They can broadcast one of six symbols to neighbors. At generation zero, those symbols mean nothing.

[FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) has the semiotic framework behind the project.

## Setup

384 prey on a 56x56 toroidal grid with 3 invisible kill zones and 100 food sources. Each prey has a split-head neural network with two independently evolvable hidden layers: a base layer (4-64 neurons) shared across all outputs, and a dedicated signal layer (2-32 neurons) for communication. The brain takes 36 inputs and produces movement decisions, signal emissions, and memory updates.

Kill zones are invisible circular regions (radius 8.0) that drift randomly across the grid (speed 0.5). Prey inside a zone lose 0.02 energy per tick - lethal in 50 ticks. Prey cannot see zones directly; they sense danger only through energy loss. Signals from other prey carry directional information (dx/dy), providing the only way to know which direction to flee. This creates structural information asymmetry: communication is the difference between random fleeing (~50% chance of going deeper) and directed escape.

Vision range is ~5.6 cells, signal range ~22.4 cells. The 4:1 ratio is the core design choice: signals reach far beyond sight, making social information the primary source of spatial awareness.

Key mechanics:

- **Invisible kill zones** - 3 zones (radius 8.0, speed 0.5) drain 0.02 energy/tick. Prey inputs 0-2 are dead (always zero). Energy input (slot 35) is the only self-signal of danger
- **Split-head architecture** - base hidden layer feeds movement and memory; signal hidden layer gives evolution independent control over communication vs. locomotion
- **Recurrent memory** - 8 memory cells updated each tick via EMA, fed back as inputs, enabling temporal reasoning
- **Cooperative food patches** - 50% of food requires 2+ nearby prey to harvest, rewarding spatial coordination
- **Kin fitness** - siblings (0.5) and cousins (0.25) boost each other's selection score, supporting altruistic signaling
- **Softmax emission** - signals emitted when one symbol dominates the softmax distribution (above 1/6 uniform baseline)
- **Signal cost** - 0.002 energy per emission creates selective pressure against noise
- **Lineage tracking** - parent and grandparent indices enable relatedness computation without artificial grouping

## Run it

```bash
cargo run --release -- [seed] [generations]       # normal run
cargo run --release -- 42 1000                    # seed 42, 1000 gens
cargo run --release -- 42 1000 --no-signals       # counterfactual (signals suppressed)
cargo run --release -- --batch 10 300             # cross-population divergence
```

CLI flags: `--pop N`, `--grid N`, `--pred N` (zone count), `--food N`, `--ticks N`, `--zone-radius F`, `--zone-speed F`, `--patch-ratio F`, `--kin-bonus F`.

Output: `output.csv` (21 columns), `trajectory.csv`, `input_mi.csv`. Batch mode also writes `divergence.csv`.

## Metrics

Per-generation CSV tracks 21 columns including:

- **MI** (mutual information) - does symbol choice correlate with sender context (zone distance)?
- **JSD** (Jensen-Shannon divergence) - do receivers change behavior depending on which signal they get?
- **Silence correlation** - do prey go quiet inside kill zones?
- **Iconicity** - are signals spatially concentrated near/inside zones?
- **Fitness coupling** - does signaling behavior correlate with survival?
- **Brain stats** - base and signal hidden layer sizes (avg/min/max) tracked separately
- **Counterfactual value** - fitness delta between signal and no-signal runs (via `--no-signals`)

Full causal chain for genuine communication requires all three simultaneously: sender encodes context (MI), receiver differentiates behavior (JSD), and that differentiation improves fitness.

src/world.rs      - Grid, invisible kill zones, food patches, memory, energy economy
src/signal.rs     - Six symbols, softmax emission, linear decay, one-tick delay
src/metrics.rs    - 10 instruments: MI, JSD, silence, trajectory, divergence, fitness coupling

```

## Findings so far

See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) for full analysis across runs.

**Runs 1-2** (84k and 68k generations): Signals evolved as a survival resource, not a communication medium - an evasion boost mechanic rewarded signal presence regardless of content. The full causal chain completed in <0.1% of generations. This led to removing the evasion boost, adding signal costs, and reducing predator density.

**Run 3** (100k generations, seed 42): MI peaked at 0.624 during a sustained surge (gen 75k-100k) after brain size naturally expanded to 15 neurons. Signals encoded predator distance (MI 0.472) and direction, with evidence of signal relaying. But the architecture was a single hidden layer - signal and movement outputs were coupled, producing spandrels. Brain expansion also showed the convention collapsed during the growth transition (gen 46k-50k).

**Architecture v2**: Split-head brain separates signal processing from movement, 6 symbols instead of 3, recurrent memory, cooperative food patches, and kin fitness. Designed to address the coupling problem and convention fragility observed in run 3.

**Kill zones** (current): Visible predators replaced with invisible kill zones. Zones are circular regions (radius 8.0) that drift randomly and drain 0.02 energy/tick - lethal in 50 ticks. Prey cannot see zones; brain inputs 0-2 are dead (always zero). Energy loss is the only self-signal of danger. This makes communication structurally necessary: a prey inside a zone knows only that energy is dropping, not which direction to flee. Signals from nearby prey carry directional information that random movement cannot provide. Early smoke tests show positive iconicity (prey signal more inside zones), receiver JSD 6x higher inside zones than outside, and receiver-fitness correlation of 0.76.
