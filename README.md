# semiotic-emergence

384 neural networks live on a 56x56 toroidal grid. Sixteen predators hunt them. They can broadcast one of three symbols to each other. At generation zero, those symbols mean nothing.

I started this project because I wanted to watch meaning come into existence. We have theories for how meaning works once it already exists, but the moment before - when a world contains no signs, no reference, no communication, and then for the first time it does - nobody really has a good account of what that transition looks like. It happened deep in evolutionary history and left no fossil record.

So I built the simplest world I could think of. Prey, predator, food, three words, and evolution. The prey have evolvable neural networks (4-16 hidden neurons, selected by evolution). They can see about 11 cells around them. They can signal up to 22. Sixteen predators chase independently. Signals are free to emit, and a prey that hears a signal while a predator is nearby gets an evasion boost - moving two cells instead of one. Spatial reproduction creates natural kin clusters - offspring appear near their parents - so communicator genes can persist through kinship proximity without artificial grouping.

Whether they actually learn to talk to each other is still an open question. So far they've learned to shut up instead. They go silent when danger is near. Which might actually be the more interesting finding - silence as the first sign, the simplest possible meaning, requiring no coordination between sender and receiver about what any particular symbol means. Just the absence of background noise becoming informative.

[FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) has the full intellectual framework behind the project. It governs all development decisions.

## Run it

```bash
cargo run --release -- [seed] [generations]       # normal run
cargo run --release -- 42 300                     # seed 42, 300 gens
cargo run --release -- 42 300 --no-signals        # counterfactual (signals suppressed)
cargo run --release -- --batch 10 300             # cross-population divergence
```

Output goes to `output.csv`, `trajectory.csv`, and `input_mi.csv`. Batch mode also writes `divergence.csv`.

## What we can see

The CSV tracks per generation: fitness, signal count, mutual information (does symbol choice correlate with predator distance?), iconicity (are signals concentrated near the predator?), receiver JSD (does hearing a signal change what a prey does?), silence correlation (do signals drop when the predator is close?), fitness coupling metrics, and silence onset detection.

The receiver-side instruments are the recent addition. We now have five instruments covering both halves of the communication channel:

1. **Receiver response spectrum** - JSD between action distributions with vs without signal. By gen 40, JSD > 0.2 - receivers genuinely change behavior in response to signals.
2. **Silence detection** - Pearson correlation between signal rate and predator proximity. Negative values confirm the temporal pattern: prey go quiet near danger.
3. **Semiotic trajectory** - How the signal-meaning mapping evolves generation by generation. Spikes in trajectory JSD mark phase transitions where meaning reorganizes.
4. **Cross-population divergence** - Do different seeds develop different conventions? Permutation-aware comparison accounts for arbitrary symbol labeling.
5. **Counterfactual value** - Run with `--no-signals` to suppress emission. Same seed, different fitness curves - the delta is the signal channel's contribution.

## The code

About 2100 lines of Rust across six files (including inline tests):

```
src/brain.rs      - Neural network (16 inputs, 4-16 evolvable hidden, 8 outputs)
src/evolution.rs  - Spatial evolution (Agent struct, local tournament, crossover, mutation)
src/world.rs      - The grid, the physics, predators, food, evasion boost
src/signal.rs     - Three symbols, linear decay, short range, one-tick delay
src/metrics.rs    - All five FRAMEWORK instruments (MI, JSD, silence, trajectory, divergence)
src/main.rs       - Generation loop, batch mode, counterfactual mode, CSV output
```

## How the world works

The grid is toroidal - no edges, no corners. All prey share a single world with multiple predators that chase independently. Kill on same cell only - no random movement, no confusion mechanic. Prey vision is `4 * scale` cells, signals travel `8 * scale` (where `scale = grid/20`). That 2:1 gap between sight and signal range is the whole reason communication could matter here: signals carry information further than eyes can see.

When a prey receives a signal and a predator is within signal range, it gets an evasion boost - moving two cells that tick instead of one. This creates a direct fitness benefit for signal-responsive prey: honest signals near real danger help receivers escape. Signals are free to emit, so the only selection pressure against noise is informational - bad signals degrade neighbor decisions.

Spatial reproduction solves the bootstrap problem. Offspring inherit the positions of dead agents and are bred from nearby parents. This creates natural kin clusters where genetically similar individuals share overlapping signal ranges - no artificial grouping needed. You can't have senders without receivers or receivers without senders, but spatially proximate relatives are more likely to share complementary wiring for both.

## How to think about changes

Every change should help us see what's actually happening, not push the simulation toward outcomes we expect. We went in looking for alarm calls and found meaningful silence instead. The framework in [FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) has the full account, but the short version: measure before you optimize, look at receivers not just senders, and design for surprise.
