# Performance Notes

## Benchmarks (2026-03-10, i7-12650H, Windows 11, release+LTO)

### Per-generation phase breakdown (500 ticks/gen)

| Pop | Grid | Pred | Food | eval | metrics | evolve | total/100g | gens/min |
|-----|------|------|------|------|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| 384 | 56 | 16 | 200 | 3.43s | 0.20s | 0.46s | 4.31s | 1,392 |
| 2000 | 128 | 80 | 1040 | 37.04s | 0.71s | 5.58s | 43.55s | 138 |
| 5000 | 200 | 200 | 2600 | 39.80s | 0.35s | 6.67s | 46.95s/20g | 25.6 |

Eval (the 500-tick simulation loop) dominates at all sizes (~85% of time).
Evolve_spatial is the second cost center (~12%), scaling with population due to
spatial tournament selection with distance checks.

### Run times at 8x scale (384 prey)

Short benchmark (100 gens, no I/O): 1,392 gens/min.
Long run (100k gens, Tee-Object logging): 535 gens/min (~2.6x I/O overhead).
Estimated long-run without Tee-Object: ~1,200-1,400 gens/min.

| Generations | Projected (no I/O) | Actual |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| 10,000 | ~7 min | - |
| 100,000 | ~72 min | 187 min (Tee-Object) |
| 500,000 | ~6 hours | - |
| 1,000,000 | ~12 hours | - |

### Scaling with population

Going from 384 to 2000 prey (5.2x) costs ~10x in eval time per gen.
Going from 2000 to 5000 (2.5x) costs ~5.4x more in eval time per gen.
Scaling is slightly worse than linear due to signal processing: each prey
iterates all active signals in `receive_detailed()`, making signal reception
O(prey * active_signals). More prey emit more signals, so it's closer to O(n^2).

### Spatial grid optimization (implemented 2026-03-09)

Before the spatial grid, the 8x scale ran at ~13 gens/min. After: ~1,392 gens/min.
That's a **~107x speedup**, not the initially estimated 3x.

Key changes:
- CellGrid with Chebyshev ring search replaces O(n) scans for nearest ally, food, prey
- Food uses swap_remove (O(1)) instead of remove (O(n))
- Nearest predator cached once per prey per tick (was computed 2-3x)
- Pre-allocated buffers for shuffled indices and position snapshots

### Rayon parallelism (tested, marginal at 384 prey)

Added rayon par_iter for the compute phase (build_inputs + brain.forward).
At 384 prey, per-item work (~10us) is too small to amortize thread scheduling.
No measurable speedup. Kept in code but does not change behavior for the
sequential apply phase (food eating, signal emission, movement).

### Bash `time` on Windows is broken

Git Bash's `time` builtin adds ~37 seconds of fixed overhead on Windows.
Use PowerShell `Measure-Command` for accurate timing. This was discovered
when all benchmarks showed identical ~39s regardless of workload.

### What target-cpu=native does NOT help

Tested `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` (AVX2 on i7-12650H).
No measurable difference - LLVM already auto-vectorizes with SSE2,
and the hot loops (Chebyshev ring search, small matrix multiply with
4-16 hidden neurons) are branch-heavy, not SIMD-friendly.

### 10k generation test run (small scale, 48 prey)

Completed 10,000 gens in ~36s actual compute. No NaN/Inf, no population
crashes (min avg fitness 82, max 551), no zero-signal gens. Brain size
evolved from 6.0 to 9-12 avg (max individual hit 16). Symbol 2 went
unused - population converged on 2-symbol vocabulary.

## 100k Generation Run (8x scale, seed 42)

**Runtime:** 11,207 seconds (~3.1 hours), ~535 gens/min. The 2.6x slowdown
vs benchmark (1,392 gens/min) is from PowerShell `Tee-Object` piping overhead.
Future runs should write directly to file.

### Three evolutionary eras

**Era 1 - Small Brain (Gen 0-46k):** avg_hidden oscillates 6-10, never settles.
Weak MI emerges early (~0.04 at gen 5k-10k) with positive sender_fit_corr (0.32) -
signaling weakly helps fitness. Iconicity is negative (prey go silent near predators).
Phase transition indicator peaks at 13.35 at gen 12,200. Then slow decline: MI drops
toward zero by gen 45k.

**Era 2 - Brain Explosion (Gen 46k-50k):** avg_hidden rockets from 10 to 15 in ~4,000
generations. Total semiotic collapse: MI, iconicity, sender_fit_corr, traj_fluct_ratio
all drop to zero simultaneously. Signals still emitted (25-40k/gen) but carry zero
information. The expanded neural architecture is unoptimized - weights that evolved for
6-10 neurons now control 15-16.

**Era 3 - Big Brain Renaissance (Gen 75k-100k):** avg_hidden locked at 14.8-15.5.
Strongest semiotic signal ever observed in this system. MI sustains above 0.2 for
6,187 consecutive generations (80,711-86,898). Peak MI = 0.6242 at gen 83,544.

### What signals encode during the MI surge (gen 78k-86k)

Input MI analysis reveals signals encode predator information:

| Input dimension | MI |
|-----------------|-----|
| Predator distance | 0.472 |
| Predator dy | 0.267 |
| Predator dx | 0.199 |
| Signal 0 strength | 0.179 (relay) |
| Signal 2 strength | 0.096 |
| Energy | 0.077 |
| Food dx/dy | ~0.001 (nothing) |

Signal-0-strength MI of 0.179 suggests signal relaying - prey that hear a signal
re-emit, creating relay chains.

### Key findings

**1. Brain size is the rate-limiting factor for semiotic emergence.** Small brains
(~6-10 neurons): MI peaks at 0.05. Big brains (~15 neurons): MI reaches 0.62. The
hidden layer capacity prediction was correct - small hidden layers can't isolate
signaling from fleeing behavior.

**2. Brain expansion destroys then rebuilds semiotic structure.** The 46k-50k
explosion creates a ~25k-generation semiotic desert before information-carrying
signals re-evolve with the new architecture. The old 6-neuron signal strategy
doesn't transfer to 15 neurons.

**3. Iconicity flips sign.** Early evolution: negative iconicity (silence near
predator). During the MI surge: positive iconicity (+0.03 to +0.08). Big brains
learned to signal toward the predator instead of going silent. The semiotic
strategy fundamentally changed.

**4. Altruistic signaling pattern.** Pearson(MI, sender_fit_corr) = -0.67 in the
final 25k gens. When signals carry the most information, senders who signal more
have lower fitness. Classic altruistic alarm calling.

**5. Receiver asymmetry reveals information value.** jsd_no_pred/jsd_pred ratio =
10.4x during the MI surge. Receivers change behavior 10x more when receiving signals
in safe contexts vs near a predator. Near danger they're already fleeing; far from
danger, the signal provides genuinely new information.

### Symbol differentiation

At peak MI (gen 83,544), inter-symbol contrasts show functional differentiation:

| Pair | Contrast (JSD) |
|------|---------------|
| Symbol 0 vs 2 | 0.622 |
| Symbol 0 vs 1 | 0.449 |
| Symbol 1 vs 2 | 0.170 |

Symbols are not interchangeable - they encode different aspects of the environment.
This approaches Level 3 semiotic emergence (functional reference).

### Phase averages

| Phase | avg_fit | MI | iconicity | sender_fit | silence_corr | avg_hidden |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Bootstrap (0-100) | 30.7 | 0.005 | +0.004 | -0.005 | -0.41 | 6.4 |
| Early (100-1k) | 47.6 | 0.014 | -0.006 | -0.003 | -0.40 | 7.5 |
| Middle (1k-5k) | 77.4 | 0.047 | -0.086 | +0.102 | -0.41 | 7.1 |
| Transition (5k-10k) | 98.9 | 0.043 | -0.117 | +0.319 | -0.42 | 7.2 |
| Maturation (10k-25k) | 89.8 | 0.016 | -0.042 | +0.119 | -0.42 | 7.9 |
| Late (25k-50k) | 81.7 | 0.009 | -0.002 | +0.051 | -0.43 | 8.9 |
| Big brain (50k-75k) | 81.1 | 0.008 | -0.005 | -0.010 | -0.42 | 12.5 |
| MI surge (75k-100k) | 82.8 | 0.216 | -0.024 | -0.043 | -0.42 | 15.2 |

### Peaks

| Metric | Peak value | Generation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Mutual information | 0.6242 | 83,544 |
| avg_fitness | 266.1 | 97,204 |
| max_fitness | 710.0 | 99,661 |
| traj_fluct_ratio | 13.35 | 12,200 |
| Negative iconicity | -0.292 | 87,355 |
| Negative silence_corr | -0.564 | 58,034 |

### Broken metrics at this scale (fixed)

`response_fit_corr`, `silence_onset_jsd`, `silence_move_delta` were effectively
broken in the 100k run - per-prey sample thresholds were too high for 384 prey
x 500 ticks. Fixed by lowering thresholds:
- `MIN_RECEIVER_SAMPLES`: 30 -> 10 (response_fit_corr)
- Silence onset threshold: 10 -> 5 (silence_onset_jsd, silence_move_delta)

### Brain expansion (post-100k)

MAX_HIDDEN raised from 16 to 124, DEFAULT_HIDDEN from 6 to 18. The 100k run
showed brain size naturally evolved to the MAX_HIDDEN=16 ceiling. With the new
ceiling, energy costs create natural selection pressure: at hidden_size=60,
drain = 0.002/tick = 1.0 over 500 ticks (all starting energy). Evolution is
free to find the optimal brain size under the Social Brain Hypothesis.

Genome is now 3108 floats (was 408). Two optimizations keep overhead manageable:

1. **Scoped mutation**: Only mutates weights for active neurons + 4 headroom.
   At hidden_size=18, mutates 22/124 neurons (~82% RNG savings).
2. **Zero-copy parent pool**: `evolve_spatial` reborrows sorted `scored` slice
   instead of cloning 384 agents (saves 4.8MB/gen of allocation).

Benchmark with new constants: 5.27s/100gen (~1,140 gens/min), ~18% slower than
old 4.31s/100gen. The overhead is from larger genome copies in crossover/elite
cloning and wider forward() stride (124 vs 16).

### Split-head architecture (v2)

Single hidden layer replaced with split-head topology:
- **Base hidden** (4-64 neurons, default 12): shared across movement, signal, and memory outputs
- **Signal hidden** (2-32 neurons, default 6): dedicated layer between base and signal outputs

Genome expanded to 5491 weights (was 3108) with 10 named segments. Two independent
hidden size genes, each with 5% mutation rate and +/-1 step. Scoped mutation now
operates per pool: base weights scoped by `base_hidden_size + 4`, signal weights
by `signal_hidden_size + 4`.

New features added alongside: 8-cell recurrent memory (EMA update), cooperative
food patches (50% require 2+ nearby prey), kin fitness via lineage tracking
(parent/grandparent indices, 0.5 siblings, 0.25 cousins), softmax signal emission.

Input count: 25 -> 36 (added food_dist, ally_dx/dy, 8 memory cells).
Output structure: 5 movement + 6 signal (via signal hidden) + 8 memory (tanh bounded).
CSV columns: 18 -> 21 (split brain stats: avg/min/max for base and signal hidden).

Neuron cost halved (0.00002 -> 0.00001) and vision range halved (11.2 -> 5.6 at
grid=56) to increase signal dependency. Signal range unchanged at 22.4 (4:1 ratio).

Early benchmarks (1000 gen, seed 42): ~1 sec/gen at 8x scale. Brain compression
observed: base hidden shrinks from 12 to ~4-5 by gen 700, signal hidden stays ~5-6.
Evolution finds it can survive with minimal base processing but retains signal capacity.
